### Hi there! 

My name is Rachel and I am a fiction writer turned software engineer. As a creator, problem-solver, and strategic thinker, I know that collaboration is powerful. Whether it's editing a manuscript or refactoring code, great products are a process, and there is always more to learn.

- ðŸ’» I am currently working on phase 2 of Your EPK, an electronic press kit app for indie filmmakers
- ðŸ›¼ I am obsessed with roller skating
- I am a graduate of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/)

Dev: React | Router | JavaScript | TypeScript | HTML5 | CSS | Sass 
TDD: Cypress | Mocha/Chai
Tools & Workflow: Git | GitHub | Slack | Wireframing | Agile
